## Code of Conduct

The Typelevel community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences.
It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth.
When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Typelevel a positive, successful, and growing community.
Whether you are new or familiar with our community, we care about making it a welcoming and safe place for you and we're here to support you.


### Our Community

Members of the Typelevel community are open, considerate, and respectful.
Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- **Being kind.** We treat our fellow community members with the empathy, respect and dignity all people deserve.
- **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
- **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
- **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Typelevel community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We remember that everyone was new to Scala at some point. We want to encourage newcomers to join our community and learn the Scala language and ecosystem. Always assume good intentions and a willingness to learn, just as you are willing to evolve your own opinion as you gain new insights.
- **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Scala users.
- **Being respectful.** We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.


### Our Standards

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected.
The Typelevel community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.
